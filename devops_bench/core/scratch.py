"""Shared scratch-space helpers: mint directories, delete only what was minted.

Mint-don't-guard: rather than trying to make deletion of an arbitrary,
caller-supplied path safe, callers only ever delete directories this module
minted under its own root. Destructive helpers here assert that invariant
rather than acting as a general-purpose permission system.

    is the same class of check ``remove_minted`` does for a minted path,
    applied to the root itself.

    must be identical across processes; this module has no such constraint,
    so it follows the system temp dir here.
