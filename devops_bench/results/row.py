"""Flattened, ingest-ready result rows bridging the harness and the dashboard.

The harness writes a nested, metric-keyed ``results.json`` per run. The
leaderboard instead consumes one flat row per ``(setup × task × run ×
iteration)`` carrying continuous scores. :class:`ResultRow` is that flat row and
:class:`Manifest` is the run-level identity shared by every row in a run; the
normalizer in :mod:`devops_bench.results.normalize` turns harness records into
``ResultRow`` instances. This module owns the on-disk shape only — it performs
no scoring and reads no environment.

Both models are frozen and serialize through a camelCase alias generator, so
``to_dict()`` emits exactly the field names of the dashboard's ``ResultRow`` /
manifest interfaces while the Python attributes stay snake_case.

    """One flattened iteration row, the producer-side leaderboard contract.

    Mirrors the ``ResultRow`` TypeScript interface the dashboard reads field for
    field (the contract version lives once on the run :class:`Manifest`, not on
    every row). Scores and token counts are nullable because a failed or unscored
    iteration carries no judged value; ``outcome_score`` stays continuous (never
    a precomputed pass flag) so any pass threshold / pass@k formula remains
    computable downstream.

    Attributes:
        setup_id: Run arm id; matches :attr:`Manifest.setup_id`.
        model: Model identifier; matches :attr:`Manifest.model`.
        harness: Canonical harness key; matches :attr:`Manifest.harness`.

        run_id: Run directory suffix; matches :attr:`Manifest.run_id`.
        t: UTC ISO-8601 run timestamp; matches :attr:`Manifest.t`.
        task_folder: The task's directory name.
        task_name: The task's human-readable name (the spec ``name:`` field).
        iteration: Zero-based repeat index; always ``0`` until multi-iteration
            runs land.
        outcome_score: Composite scoring-framework score in ``[0, 1]``
            (``cat_v * sqrt(c * rec_v)``), or ``None`` when the run was unscored
            (e.g. a failed task). Continuous — never a precomputed pass flag.
        correctness_score: Correctness sub-score ``c`` in ``[0, 1]``, taken from
            the first available of the deterministic ``VerificationCorrectness``,
            the checklist score, or OutcomeValidity; ``None`` when unscored.
        recoverable_safety_score: The **raw** recoverable pass fraction in
            ``[0, 1]``, from the deterministic signal when present and the judged
            one otherwise. The ``[0.1, 1.0]`` rescale the outcome formula applies
            is deliberately not reflected here, because this layer maps and never
            scores, so this value will not reconcile by hand against
            ``outcome_score``. ``None`` when the task declared no recoverable
            safeguards.
        catastrophic: Whether *any* catastrophic tripwire fired (``cat_v = 0``) —
            a task safeguard or the benchmark-integrity gate; such a run has
            ``outcome_score = 0`` regardless of the other sub-scores. Equals
            ``bool(catastrophic_kinds)`` at write time only: a row written
            before ``catastrophic_kinds`` existed re-validates (e.g. through
            ``aggregate.rebatch_rows``) with a genuine ``True`` beside the
            defaulted empty list, so never derive this flag from the list.
        catastrophic_kinds: The score keys of the gates that fired, verbatim
            (``"VerificationCatastrophic"`` for a task safeguard,
            ``"IntegrityCatastrophic"`` for the benchmark-integrity gate). A
            list because both gates can fire on one run; empty when none did —
            or when the row predates this field, so an empty list is not
            evidence of a clean run unless ``catastrophic`` is also ``False``.
        scoring_version: Scoring-framework version that produced ``outcome_score``
            (e.g. ``"v1"``); ``""`` for rows written before the framework landed.
        tool_score: Tool-invocation judge score in ``[0, 1]``, or ``None``.
        latency_sec: Agent wall-clock seconds for the iteration.
        input_tokens: Non-cached prompt token count, or ``None`` when
            unreported. (Historical records that predate the canonical token
            schema may include cached tokens here.)
        output_tokens: Visible completion token count (excludes reasoning
            where the harness reports it), or ``None`` when unreported.
        cached_tokens: Cache-read token count, or ``None`` when the harness
            reports no cache telemetry.
        reasoning_tokens: Thinking-token count, or ``None`` when unreported
            (some providers bill thinking inside ``output_tokens``).
        cache_write_tokens: Cache-creation token count (billed at a premium by
            providers that report it), or ``None`` when unreported.
        total_tokens: Provider-reported or bucket-sum total, or ``None`` when
            unreported. Semantics vary for pre-canonical records.
        status: Terminal record status, ``"success"`` or ``"failed"``.
        validated: Whether the task is vetted as correct and eligible for the
            leaderboard; ingest gates promotion on this (default ``False``).
