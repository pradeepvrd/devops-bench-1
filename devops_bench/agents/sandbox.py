"""Run the agent-under-test inside a container with a scoped view of the world.

WHY THIS EXISTS. CLI agent harnesses invoke the agent binary as a plain
subprocess inheriting the operator's filesystem and environment, so the agent
can reach the benchmark's own material: ``tasks/**/task.yaml`` (the judge
rubric and ``verification_spec`` — the answer key), scoring and detection
code, prior results, the operator's cloud credentials and admin kubeconfig.
The detection layer is a tripwire, not a boundary; this module is the
boundary. See ``docs/proposals/agent-sandboxing.md`` for the design and the
two observed incidents that shaped it.

The container sees exactly four things, and what is ABSENT matters more than
what is present:

* the per-run **workspace** at ``/workspace``, with ``HOME`` repointed to
  ``/workspace/home`` so a bare ``~`` cannot resolve to the operator's profile
* the task's own seeded **fixtures**, mounted read-write under the container
  home (see :func:`discover_fixture_mounts`) — task input, not answer material
* a generated single-cluster **kubeconfig**, read-only at ``/creds/kubeconfig``:
  one cluster, one context, no ``exec:`` plugin blocks, never the operator's
  own kubeconfig or Application Default Credentials
* an explicit **env overlay**, passed by value as ``-e`` flags after a deny
  filter — never scraped from ``os.environ``

Never in the container: the repo checkout, ``results/``, operator ``$HOME``,
gcloud config, Terraform state, or the Docker socket (with the socket the
boundary would be decorative, and it is tempting precisely because a kind
cluster is Docker-hosted).

Completeness is a security property: an under-provisioned agent improvises
rather than giving up (observed: a missing fixture mount escalated to a
privileged pod reading the bench checkout through the node's host disk), so
refusal here is always loud — a sandbox that cannot be built raises
:class:`~devops_bench.core.errors.SandboxError` instead of quietly running
the agent on the host.

        Two parameters are rejected rather than reinterpreted, because both

        * ``env`` replaces the whole child environment in the host ``run``;
          forwarding a full mapping (typically a copy of ``os.environ``) is
          exactly the credential-inheritance channel the sandbox removes.
        * ``input`` needs an open stdin, and the container deliberately runs
          without ``-i``; accepting it would drop the data on the floor.

        The container is reaped by name on every exit path. ``--rm`` only
        removes a container once *the container's own process* exits; a
        ``docker run`` client killed out from under it (exactly what happens
        when the host-side timeout fires) leaves the container running in the
