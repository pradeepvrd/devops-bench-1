    """Orchestrate a background chaos disruption and its verification.

    The manager runs on a daemon thread alongside the agent under test: it
    waits on the typed trigger, drives the typed
    :class:`~devops_bench.chaos.base.Fault` (via ``action.inject``) to inject
    the planned disruption, then resolves the spec's ``verify:`` key against the
    per-task verification mapping and runs
    :meth:`~devops_bench.verification.VerifierAgent.run_entry` on the resolved
    entry, so the entry's resolved mode (``converge`` vs ``assert``) governs
    whether the check polls or evaluates once, exactly as it does in the
    post-run verification pass. The load fault reaches its target through the
    target Service's external LoadBalancer IP — the manager resolves it from the
    Service status and rewrites the action's load URL before injection — so the
    fortio spike works from any runner location (in-VPC bastion or off-VPC
    local). The ``kubectl port-forward`` the fault still owns is kept as a
    fallback for when LB resolution fails or the caller opts out.

    Args:
        target_deployment: Deployment the load fault should disrupt. Also the
            Service name (the optimize-scale stack seeds the Service with the
            same name), used here to look up the external LB IP and threaded
            onto ``ctx.env`` for the fault's port-forward fallback.
        namespace: Namespace the deployment / Service lives in; threaded onto
            ``ctx.env``.
        verification_mapping: Name-keyed mapping of
            :class:`~devops_bench.verification.spec.VerificationEntry` the
            chaos ``verify:`` reference is resolved against. The manager looks
            up the entry by name and hands it directly to
            ``VerifierAgent.run_entry``, so the entry's resolved mode governs
            the check. Empty mapping disables verification lookups.
        skip_port_forward: When True, the fault runs without resolving an LB IP
            and without opening a ``kubectl port-forward``. The E2E smoke
            harness (against :class:`~devops_bench.deployers.NoOpDeployer`)
            flips this on so tests can exercise the wiring without a real
            cluster.

    Attributes:
        chaos_active_event: Set by the chaos fault once the disruption is
            observably active, so the harness can synchronize the operator
