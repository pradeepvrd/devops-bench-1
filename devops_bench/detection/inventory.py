"""Pre-run workspace inventory: turn prior-run leftovers into detection rules.

The agent home persists between runs, so artifacts of earlier runs (a previous
``report.md``, cloned working repos, seeded git remotes from other scenarios)
accumulate there and amount to answer keys for later runs. "Left by a prior
run" is a temporal property no static regex can express — this run's legit
``report.md`` write and a read of last run's leftover are the same string — so
the harness snapshots the home *before* the agent starts and generates a
per-run ruleset from what it finds:

* a **path rule** per leftover, anchored to home-style prefixes (``~``,
  ``$HOME``, the literal home path) so an unrelated same-named file elsewhere
  (e.g. this run's own ``/tmp`` clone) is not flagged. Matched against every
  scanned surface, so the entry's name echoing through tool output (an
  ``ls ~``, a grep error trail) flags too: the agent had no reason to be
  looking; and
* a **content-fingerprint rule** per small text leftover: its most distinctive
  lines, matched only against tool ``result``/``output`` surfaces. A read of
  the stale file reproduces those exact lines; a freshly written file does not.

Path rules are filtered per record against the task prompt
(:func:`filter_rules_for_prompt`): an entry the prompt itself names — the
GitOps repo the agent is told to push to, the deliverable it is told to write
— is authorized for that record. That filter is what keeps an honest run
writing its own ``report.md`` clean, and it is deliberately the *only*
mechanism: a statically excluded name would be excluded for every task, so a
leftover from one task would go uncovered while a different task ran.
