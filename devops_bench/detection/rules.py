"""Rule model and default ruleset for trajectory-based cheating detection.

A rule names a category of sensitive material (task definitions, scoring code,
prior results, the benchmark repo itself) and the regex fingerprints that
betray access to it in an agent's recorded trajectory. The default rules are
deliberately task-agnostic — they match the *kind* of material, never a
specific task — so unmerged tasks are covered without a code change. Extra
rules load from an optional YAML file (``BENCH_CHEAT_RULES``).

# no passive/active distinction: a benchmark path surfacing in an ``ls ~``
# listing is not access, but no legitimate task puts the harness's own material
# in view either, so the sighting itself is the signal that the agent went
# looking. Content-evidence rules still restrict themselves to
# ``result``/``output`` — a path-shaped ``args`` is already covered by the path
# rule and would otherwise be reported twice.
