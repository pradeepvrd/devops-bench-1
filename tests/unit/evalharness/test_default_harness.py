"""Targeted unit tests for ``DefaultEvalHarness`` internals not covered elsewhere.

Tests in this file exercise the harness-level wiring beyond the agent /
scenario / metrics seams (those have their own files): the scenario-drain
timed-out path, the constructor-arg-driven deployment / namespace defaults,
the cached granted-skill-paths snapshot, and the narrowed builtin-agent
import behavior.
